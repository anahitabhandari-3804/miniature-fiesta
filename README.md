Face Recognition System
A robust Face Recognition System built using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques. This system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces in real-time using a webcam or from static images.

Features
Face Detection: Detects faces in images and video feeds using pre-trained models (e.g., Haar Cascades or DNN models).
Face Recognition: Identifies faces by comparing them with stored encodings using techniques like FaceNet or dlib.
Real-time Operation: Processes frames from a webcam for live face detection and recognition.
Custom Dataset Support: Easily add and train with new faces.
Scalability: Capable of handling large datasets with optimized performance.
